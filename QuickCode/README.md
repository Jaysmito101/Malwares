# QuickCode

This is a very strong encryption alogrithm.

I first thought of it a few years ago in a contest to design a good yet simple encrypton algorithm.

# How does it work ?

Say we have our normal cipherset of ASCII:

    0 1 2 3 .... 255
    
Now in ceasar cipher you would rotate this by a key say 3:

    253 254 255 0 1 ... 252

But as you can guess it this is very predictable!

What quickcode does is a bit more complex!

We again start with out basic charset :

    0 1 2 3 ... 255

Now instead of a single digit key we have a string password say `"12345"`

We loop through the data we want to encrypt and for each change the charset like for first one out dividor will be `'1'` which is `49` so our new charset will be:

    48 47 ... 1 0 49 50 ... 255
    
Get it! 

Now wwe cycle through out password for the whole string.

A major fallback of this would be the password being cycled through there might be patterns!

To solve it everytime we complete one cycle we change the cipherset randomly a bit based on the current index in main data as seed! 

Bingo we made a Encryption Algorithm!

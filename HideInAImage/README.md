# HideInAImage

The best ans most secure way to hide any kind of text or file inside a image.

## How to use ? 

    USAGE:
      imghide <mode> <input image> [data type] [data]
      Modes:
                  [1] /h for hiding
                  [2] /u for unhiding

      Data types:
                  [1] /f for file
                  [2] /t for text
                  
## How does it work ? Why is it better ?

Now most programs hiding data in a image uses some specifics of the file format like in case of `PNG` you would usually hide data after the `IEND` chunk or create your own chunk in between which normal programs will not read.

But but, isn't that pretty obvious? If you are looking for data inside an image will you not look for any suspicious chunk? Will any normal scanner not scan for these odd chunks?

You know where someone is will look last or try to figure out last?

Give it a try: 

The source code of the program is hidden inside this image! Can you figure it out before looking at the source?

Congratulations! You figured it out!

  See there are many transparent pixels! Now why waste the (R, G, B) values of those pixels? Store the data there!
